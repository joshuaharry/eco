# Research Agenda

## Finding Code
- Switch to Go instead of shell for robustness/performance and concurrency
- Generalization; find more things than JavaScript libraries (search more ecosystems via JSON interpreter)
- Interpreter of strategies with built-in logging, statistics tracking, a nice GUI, and *resumable computation*
  - Pick up where you left off when things start to break

## Compiler
- Change the semantics of JavaScript: Find ways of hacking around the proxy problems
  - Compare/contrast semantics of different implementation choices?
- Other experiments with code:
  - Shuffle the result of `Object.keys` to get a measure of how much people rely on hash tables?

## Testing Code
- Random test generator with the contract library
